# CHANGELOG

## 1.2.3 (2022-02-02)

* Fix deprecation warning.

## 1.2.2 (2022-02-02)

* Dependency updates (prawn, prawn-svg, add prawn-table). This update might break tests as PDF are rendered slightly differently.
* Fix deprecation warning.

## 1.2.1 (2022-02-01)

* Add convenience method to add line_items to invoices (`Invoice#add_line_item(options)`). Takes the same options as `LineItem.new(options)`.

## 1.2.0 (2021-12-22)

This brings changes made for WebTranslateIt.comâ€™s billing system:

* Tax rate is a full percent number (for instance `21.0` for a 21% tax rate, `10.0` for a 10% tax rate). This is a breaking change compared to the previous `0.21` for 21% tax rate and `0.1` for 10% tax rate, but it is more convenient to use.
* Invoices were updated to call the document `Invoice` if the document was not paid or `Receipt` if the document was paid.
